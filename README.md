MDB ANALYSIS (PROJECT 2) 

This project utilizes IMDb datasets to explore and answer various questions related to movies, actors, genres, and job categories.

The dataset is preprocessed and combined using PySpark, a robust tool for data processing and manipulation. The IMDb dataset contains information such as movie titles, genres, actors, and ratings.

The project includes some descriptive analysis in the beginning:

-An analysis of movie genres, including the total number of unique genres and a horizontal bar chart of the top genres by average rating.

-An examination of job categories in the movie industry, identifying the total number of unique job categories.

-The project outcomes offer insights into trends and patterns within the movie industry, such as popular genres, highly-rated movies, and the performance of actors over time.


In this project, we also have addressed the following questions:

1) Identify all the "movies" featuring "Johnny Depp" and "Helena Bonham Carter."
The code filters the dataset to find movies in which both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter have appeared.

2) Discover all the "movies" featuring "Brad Pitt" after 2010.
The code filters the dataset to find movies that Brad Pitt has appeared in since 2010.

3)Determine the number of "movies" "acted" by "Zendaya" per year.
The code calculates the yearly number of movies in which Zendaya has acted.

4) Uncover the "movies" with an average rating greater than "9.7" and released in "2019".
The code filters the dataset to find movies with an average rating higher than 9.7 and released in 2019.

5) Identify and visualize the top 5 most active actors in the movie industry between 2017 and 2022.
